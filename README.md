## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an AI-powered browser agent that automates repetitive web tasks using **Playwright** and **Gemini (Google AI Studio)** - all through a clean and powerful UI powered by **WebUI**.

It performs actions like:
- Filling forms
- Navigating websites
- Searching online
- Automating job applications, document writing, and more

The agent uses natural language prompts and mimics human interactions in real-time using browser automation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Build a self-operating browser agent using AI + automation
- Perform tasks in real-time using browser agents and prompts
- Eliminate repetitive workflows with intelligent automation
- Use personal browsers (like Chrome or Edge) for logged-in actions

### WebUI:
WebUI is built on Gradio and supports most of `browser-use` functionalities. This UI is designed to be user-friendly and enables easy interaction with the browser agent.

### Expanded LLM Support:
We've integrated support for various Large Language Models (LLMs), including: Google, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Ollama etc. And we plan to add support for even more models in the future.

### Custom Browser Support:
We can use your own browser with our tool, eliminating the need to re-login to sites or deal with other authentication challenges. This feature also supports high-definition screen recording.

### Persistent Browser Sessions:
We can choose to keep the browser window open between AI tasks, allowing us to see the complete history and state of AI interactions.
